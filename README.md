# jCCAPI
A Java Library for CCAPI 2.70

**About**
-jCCAPI is a Java compatible library for the popular Control Console API (CCAPI) on the Playstation 3 system.
This allows you to create cross-platform applications for CCAPI (Yay! Mac and Android CCAPI tools!) and is
completely open source, so you can build your own functions for the lib!

**How To Use**
-Simply take the .JAR from the release folder, and import it as an External Jar library in your favorite Java
IDE. From there, create a new instance of jCCAPI, and you are good to go!

**Note: Make sure you have 2.70 CCAPI installed on your PS3 or it will NOT work!**

**Additional Information**
-All of the other Java files aside from jCCAPI.java are different variables for various methods in jCCAPI. This
includes Buzzer Types, NotifyIcons, Reboot Options, LED Colors, and more!

-An example application source is included in the examples folder. If you are unaware of how to use this library,
simply take a look at the different uses of the libary in the example source.

**Happy Modding!**
